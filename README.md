Rick and Morty Character List

    This app shows characters from the TV show Rick and Morty. It uses a special website called a GraphQL API to get the data. You can see each character’s name, picture, status (Alive, Dead, or Unknown), species, gender, and where they come from.

How to Use

    Open the App
    After you run the app, you’ll see a list of characters on the main page.

Filtering

    At the top, you can choose if you only want to see characters who are Alive, Dead, or Unknown.
    You can also type in a species (like “Human” or “Alien”) to filter by species.

Sorting

    You can pick how to sort the list: by name or by origin, in ascending or descending order.

Infinite Scrolling

    Keep scrolling down, and more characters will load automatically. There’s no need to click a “next” button.

Language Switcher

    Look at the bottom of the page. You can pick a language (English, German, or Albanian) and the labels on the page will change.

How to Install and Run
